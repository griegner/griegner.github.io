##### about
---
I'm a research technician at the [Brain Mechanisms of Pain and Health Lab](https://www.zeidanlab.com/) at UC San Diego and previously a neurosience undergraduate student at USC and the [Brain and Music Lab](https://dornsife.usc.edu/labs/brainandmusic/). 

My research experience is in cognitive neuroscience, using experimental and computational methods to uncover how the brain represents both pain and music. Through exposure to traditional and emerging analytical tools, I've since found an interest in the development of these open-source resources to insure accessibility and reproducibility across research settings.
