##### about
---
I'm a research technician at the [Brain Mechanisms of Pain and Health Lab](https://www.zeidanlab.com/) at UC San Diego and previously a neuroscience undergraduate student at USC and the [Brain and Music Lab](https://dornsife.usc.edu/labs/brainandmusic/). 

My research experience is in human neuroscience, using psychophysics and neuroimaging to investigate the underpinnings of complex cognition including music, memory, and pain. I've since found an interest in developing analysis tools to make computational methods more accessible and reproducible across research settings.
